A logisitc regressor classifier bulid from scratch in Python and tested on wildfire dataset with comparison logistic regression classifier of scikit-learn.

# Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification technique which is used to predict distinct set of classes
based on given observations. As linear regression technique produces continuous output 
values, logistic regression transforms those output values into a probability value using a 
sigmoid function. These probabilistic values can then further be represented into two or more 
distinct classes.
